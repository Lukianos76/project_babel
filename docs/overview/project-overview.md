## Overview

Project Babel is a powerful translation management system designed specifically for game mods and content. It provides a robust platform for managing translations, facilitating collaboration between translators, and ensuring high-quality localization across different languages.

## Key Concepts

### Mod

A "mod" is the unit of content to be translated. It contains game files and metadata. Each mod can have multiple target translations, one per language.

### Role System

Project Babel supports:
- Global roles: define what a user can do across the entire app.
- Mod-level roles: define what a user can do within a specific translation project.

This dual-role model allows flexibility for collaborative and community-driven translations.
