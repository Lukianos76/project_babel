# Caching Strategy

## Purpose
_Describe the caching strategies and mechanisms implemented across Project Babel._

## Scope
_This document covers caching policies, invalidation rules, and performance optimization._

## Dependencies

- [automatic-translation.md](automatic-translation.md)
- [caching.md](../api/caching.md)
- [caching-strategy.md](../architecture/caching-strategy.md)

## Note on Scope
This document focuses on the technical implementation of caching strategies at the feature level, including specific caching mechanisms for translations, API responses, and database queries. For high-level architectural decisions about caching, including system-wide caching policies and infrastructure choices, please refer to [CACHING_STRATEGY.md](../architecture/caching-strategy.md).

## Overview

The caching system is designed to optimize performance by reducing load on critical resources. This strategy covers multiple cache levels:

### 1. Translation Cache
- In-memory cache for frequently used translations
- Smart invalidation based on modifications
- Preloading strategy for popular languages

### 2. API Cache
- API response caching with configurable TTL
- Conditional invalidation based on parameters
- Distributed caching strategy for multi-server environments

### 3. Database Cache
- Cache for frequent queries
- Aggregated results caching
- Two-level caching strategy (L1/L2)

## Configuration

```yaml
cache:
  translation:
    ttl: 3600
    max_size: 1000
    preload_languages: ['en', 'fr', 'de']
  
  api:
    ttl: 300
    max_size: 10000
    invalidation_rules:
      - pattern: '/api/v1/translations/*'
        ttl: 600
      - pattern: '/api/v1/users/*'
        ttl: 300
  
  database:
    l1:
      type: 'memory'
      max_size: 1000
    l2:
      type: 'redis'
      ttl: 1800
```

## Invalidation Strategies

### 1. Time-based Invalidation
- Standard TTL (Time To Live)
- Dynamic TTL based on access frequency
- Progressive invalidation

### 2. Event-based Invalidation
- Invalidation on data modification
- Invalidation on configuration changes
- Invalidation on translation updates

### 3. Conditional Invalidation
- Based on query parameters
- Based on access rights
- Based on system load

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Metrics
- Hit/miss rates
- Average response time
- Memory usage
- Resource load

### Alerts
- Performance thresholds
- Critical memory usage
- Invalidation errors
- Consistency issues

## Best Practices

1. **Configuration**
   - Adjust TTLs based on usage
   - Configure memory limits
   - Define invalidation rules

2. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor key metrics
   - Analyze usage patterns
   - Optimize configurations

3. **Maintenance**
   - Regular cleanup
   - Configuration updates
   - Strategy review
