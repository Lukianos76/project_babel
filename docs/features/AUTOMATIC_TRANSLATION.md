# Automatic Translation

## Overview

Project Babel integrates with external translation services to provide initial automatic translations for new content. This feature helps speed up the translation process by providing a first draft that can then be reviewed and refined by human translators.

## Supported Services

### DeepL
- High-quality translations
- Support for multiple languages
- API-based integration
- Context-aware translations

### Google Translate
- Wide language coverage
- Cost-effective for large volumes
- API-based integration
- Quick response times

### Microsoft Translator
- Enterprise-grade service
- Custom translation models
- API-based integration
- Neural network technology

## Integration

### Configuration

```yaml
# config/packages/translation.yaml
translation:
    providers:
        deepl:
            api_key: '%env(DEEPL_API_KEY)%'
            default_language: 'en'
        google:
            api_key: '%env(GOOGLE_TRANSLATE_API_KEY)%'
            default_language: 'en'
        microsoft:
            api_key: '%env(MICROSOFT_TRANSLATE_API_KEY)%'
            default_language: 'en'
```

### Usage

```php
class TranslationService
{
    public function translate(string $text, string $targetLanguage, ?string $provider = null): string
    {
        $provider = $provider ?? $this->getDefaultProvider();
        
        return match($provider) {
            'deepl' => $this->translateWithDeepL($text, $targetLanguage),
            'google' => $this->translateWithGoogle($text, $targetLanguage),
            'microsoft' => $this->translateWithMicrosoft($text, $targetLanguage),
            default => throw new \InvalidArgumentException('Unsupported translation provider')
        };
    }
}
```

## Workflow

1. **Content Submission**
   - New content is submitted to the system
   - Source language is detected or specified

2. **Automatic Translation**
   - System selects appropriate translation provider
   - Content is translated to target language
   - Translation is stored with metadata

3. **Human Review**
   - Translated content is marked as "machine translated"
   - Human translators can review and edit
   - Changes are tracked and versioned

4. **Quality Control**
   - Translations are reviewed for accuracy
   - Cultural context is verified
   - Technical terminology is checked

## Best Practices

### Provider Selection
- Use DeepL for high-priority content
- Use Google Translate for general content
- Use Microsoft Translator for enterprise needs

### Cost Management
- Implement caching for repeated translations
- Set up usage quotas
- Monitor API costs

### Quality Assurance
- Review automatic translations
- Maintain translation memory
- Track common corrections

## Limitations

### Technical Limitations
- API rate limits
- Character limits per request
- Supported language pairs

### Quality Limitations
- Context-specific translations may need review
- Cultural nuances may be missed
- Technical terminology may need verification

## Future Improvements

### Planned Features
- Custom translation models
- Machine learning improvements
- Additional provider support
- Quality scoring system

### Integration Enhancements
- Batch translation support
- Real-time translation
- Custom terminology management
- Translation memory integration
